# Quick Capture (Angular)

A minimal “capture-first” app:
1) Save a quick item (minimal typing)
2) Then show a Trigger Card (future: reminders/suggestions)

## MVP (Phase 1)
- Capture text + type (Remember/Task/Idea)
- Show list of saved items
- Trigger Card appears after save (stub today)
- Local-only state (no backend yet)

## Tech Stack
- Angular (standalone components + routing)
- SCSS
- (Later) API + DB + Auth + Sync
- (Later) PWA support for mobile install

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
ng serve -o
